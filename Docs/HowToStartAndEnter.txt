For Orgo you should use **yarn**, not pnpm.

Reason:

* The root `package.json` has

  ```json
  "packageManager": "yarn@1.22.17"
  ```

  and the monorepo tooling (`package-scripts.js`, CI commands) is wired to `yarn` and `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`.

pnpm is fine for your other project; just use different commands per folder.

Concrete steps for Orgo on your machine:

1. From the Orgo root:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\MyCode\Orgo
   yarn install
   ```

2. To run everything in dev (API + web in parallel, via Turbo):

   ```powershell
   yarn dev
   ```

   This runs `turbo run dev --parallel` from the root. 

3. Or run each app separately:

   * API (NestJS, port 5002):

     ```powershell
     cd C:\MyCode\Orgo\apps\api
     yarn dev
     ```

   * Web UI (Next.js, port 3000):

     ```powershell
     cd C:\MyCode\Orgo\apps\web
     yarn dev
     ```



4. Open the interface to test:

   * Web app: `http://localhost:3000/` (root routes to the Insights overview page).
   * API / Swagger: `http://localhost:5002/docs`. 

So: keep using **pnpm** for your other project, but for **Orgo** follow the repo and use **yarn classic (1.22.x)**.
